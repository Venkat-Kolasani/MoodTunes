🎧 MoodTunes – AI-Generated Music Based on Your Mood
🧠 Concept
MoodTunes is a web-based AI experience that allows users to speak their current mood, which is then interpreted by AI to generate a custom, royalty-free music track in real time. It aims to merge mental well-being with creativity and entertainment.

🌐 Live Demo Flow (Website Version)
